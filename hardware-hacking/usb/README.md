# Universal Serial Bus (USB)

USB was designed to standardize the connection of **peripherals to personal computers**, 
both to exchange data with and to supply electric power.


## Rubber Ducky

To the human eye, the USB Rubber Ducky looks like an unremarkable **USB flash drive**. 

Plug it into a computer, though, and **the machine sees it as a USB keyboard** 
which means it accepts keystroke commands from the device just as if a person was typing them in.

**Johannes Schilling** implemented this Rubber Ducky prototype as part of his bachelor's 
thesis.
