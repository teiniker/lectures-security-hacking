# Joint Test Action Group (JTAG)

JTAG is an industry standard (defined in IEEE 1491.1) for **debugging and testing** increasingly 
complex PCBs. JTAG interfaces on embedded devices allow us to read and write memory contents, 
including dumping the entire firmware, which means it serves as a way to gain complete control 
of a target device.
