# Hardware Hacking 

Hardware hacking refers to the process of **modifying or manipulating electronic devices** 
and their hardware components to achieve functionality not originally intended by the 
manufacturer. 

We explore the most basic hardware hacking techniques, including interfacing with UART, I2C, SPI, and JTAG:

* [Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART)](uart/)
* [Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)](i2c/)
* [Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)](spi/)
* [Joint Test Action Group (JTAG)](jtag/)

Tools needed for hardware hacking:

* [USB-TTL-Serial-Adapter](tools/USB-TTL-Adapter/)
* [Bus Pirate ](tools/BusPirate/)
* [Logic Analyzer](tools/LogicAnalyzer/)
* [ISP-Programmer](tools/ISP-Programmer/)
