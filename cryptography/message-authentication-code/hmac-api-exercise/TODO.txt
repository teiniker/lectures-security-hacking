Exercise: HMAC API 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the "hmac" example, refactor the code in the following ways:

A) uint8_t *calculate_fingerprint(char* key_string, uint8_t* data, size_t size, size_t *result_len);
Move the related code for calculating the HMAC into a function called "calculate_fingerprint()".
Use the given "main()" function to test your implementation.
=> HMAC: dcdb1aacc7857fbc8bb8cb60a015ae7e131f5fd7180d6bd2f8508cdb21ffa658

B) Fix Memory Management 
The "hmac" example has some bugs regarding memory management - it creates memory leaks!!
Fix the memory management in your implementation and use valgring to verify your implementation:  
$ valgrind ./build/hmac-api
=> All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
