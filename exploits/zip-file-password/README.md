# Crack ZIP File Password

Cracking a ZIP file password using John the Ripper (JtR) involves several steps:

* **Extract the ZIP Hash**: John the Ripper works with a hash of the password, 
    not the ZIP file itself. We have to extract this hash.
    The `zip2john` tool, included in JtR Jumbo, extracts the hash from a ZIP file.

* **Run John the Ripper**: Now that we have the hash, we can run John the Ripper 
    to crack the password.


_Example:_ Extract and crack the ZIP password 

```bash
$ zip2john Data.zip > password 
$ john password
```

Now we can use `Data.zip` with the found password:

```bash
$ unzip file.zip
```

## Sertup

We can either use [Kali Linux](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AzsF4Mvh1HJ8k6OW5W5hQ5CF0HdqA51l) in a virtual machine, or build John
the Ripper from source:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/openwall/john.git
$ cd john/src
$ ./configure && make
```
