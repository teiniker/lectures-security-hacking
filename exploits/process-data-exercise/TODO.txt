Exercise: Process Data 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a binary which processes measurement data:

$ ./process_data measurement-001.txt
timestamp,float_value
2023-11-13 17:31:38.190099,0.7955792252715449
2023-11-13 17:32:38.190099,4.7054602824073815
2023-11-13 17:33:38.190099,3.890522501618472
...

A) Reverse Engineering 
Use reverse engineering techniques to find out some vulnerabilities in the 
given binary.

TODO: List vunerabilities you have found

B) Exploit 
Based on the list of found vulnerabilities, create an attack to exploit 
each vulnerability.

TODO: Describe each attack
