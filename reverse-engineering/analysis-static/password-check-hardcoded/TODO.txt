LabExam 2022-12-17 G2: Reverse Engineering - Hardcoded Password
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the executable named "password_check".

$ ./password_check 
password> student
Login rejected, invalid password!

A) Extract Password [3 points] 
Use static reverse engineering techniques to extract the hardcoded password.
Try to login with the found password - only when you see the following message, 
you have extracted the right password:
    "Welcome, you have entered a valid password!"   

    TODO: "hjHGzu&56nm;"


B) Storage Algorithm [7 points]
Describe the algorithm which has been used to build the password:

    TODO: 
    i) iteral="VvnoWnioi8hjHGzu&56nm;:mkhjghfg"
    ii) substring: 
        starting with: literal+10
        length:6*2
        => hjHGzu&56nm;
    iii) compare this substring with the entered password
        


The small print
---------------

1. Project name: Rename the project (and the submitted ZIP file) so 
that instead of "MyName" your name is used. 
Please note that projects that do not comply with the naming 
convention will be deducted 50% of the points!

2. Manual review: A manual code review is performed for each solution 
when grading. 

3. Compiler errors: Implementations that don't compile won't count.

4. Solutions that are obviously copied or copied will be assessed 
negatively (with 0 points).
