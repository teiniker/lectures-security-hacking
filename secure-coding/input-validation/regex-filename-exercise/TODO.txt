Exercise: Filename (Regular Expression)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A file name should be validated before further processing in order to avoid path 
traversal attacks.

A) Regular Expression 
    Define a regular expression which can validate file names.
    A filename can contain letters (upper or lower case), numbers and the underscore.
    The minimum length is one character and the maximum length is 255 characters.
    The file extension can be between 0 and 3 characters long and can only contain 
    letters (upper or lower case).
    Example: Valid filename = "filename.c"
    Example: Valid filename = "filename"
    Example: Invalid filename = "../filename.c"

B) bool is_valid_filename(char *filename);
    Implement this function. 
    Return "true" if it is a valid file name, otherwise "false".
