Exercise: Base64 Encoding
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function "base64()" that converts 3 bytes into 4 characters and stores 
them in a string on the heap.

Examples: 3 Bytes -> 4 Characters
 
  Bytes:
  	0x1A       0xCF       0xD2
    0001 1010  1100 1111  1101 0010
    
  6 bit Values:
    000110  101100  111111  010010
    0x06    0x2C    0x3F    0x12
    G       s       /       S 

Each 3 bytes are combined into 24 bits and then broken down into 4 groups of 
6 bits each.

The 6 bits are used as an index to read a character from the following string.
   "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/"

In this way, the "base64()" function should consist of three bytes of the
Input array's add 4 characters to the output string.

The length of the output can be derived from the length of the input array.
This means that a string of the correct length can be created in the heap 
at the beginning of the function.

In this simplified version of Base64 encoding, only arrays whose length is 
a multiple of 3 should be used.
The result is checked in the "main()" function via assert statements.
